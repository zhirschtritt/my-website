This won't be the first time I've started a blog and probably not the last, but I'm pretty excited about this one! Mostly I'm excited about sharing the many projects I'm working on and keeping tabs on myself day-to-day. Also I just wanted a website to experiment with some new tech and workflows. This website is hosted on AWS S3 (public build and images) and versioned on Github. Here we go!
